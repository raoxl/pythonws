PyTorch Tutorials
-----------------


1. [Deep Learning with PyTorch: a 60-minute blitz](Deep Learning with PyTorch.ipynb)
   - A perfect introduction to PyTorch's torch, autograd, nn and optim APIs
   - If you are a former Torch user, you can check out this instead: [Introduction to PyTorch for former Torchies](Introduction to PyTorch for former Torchies.ipynb)
2. Custom C extensions
   - [Write your own C code that interfaces into PyTorch via FFI](Creating%20Extensions%20using%20FFI.md)
3. [Writing your own neural network module that uses numpy and scipy](Creating extensions using numpy and scipy.ipynb)
4. [Reinforcement (Q-)Learning with PyTorch](Reinforcement (Q-)Learning with PyTorch.ipynb)
